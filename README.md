# A Simple feed forward neural network  

## A feed forward neural network built from scratch using the standard c++ library and pybind11 for seemless python integration. 

This project is built to run on Nvidia geforce rtx gpu's. Project goals:

- Create a fully connected neural network with a user defined architecture. 
- Module can be easily called from python.
- Trained network can be easily saved.
- Runs on gpu for synchronized computation of network.
- Network can be easily visualized.

## How to compile project.

The easiest way to see how this works is to watch the series, but here's the short version.

1. Clone this project
2. Create a build folder in the MLP directory.
3. Run Make from the build directory
4. Python package can be accessed from build directory using "import MLP"

## How to use package.
